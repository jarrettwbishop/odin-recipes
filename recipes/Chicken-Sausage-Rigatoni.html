        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> We consider pasta night a holiday—one that we like to celebrate at least once a week, if not more. 
            If you agree, you’re in luck. This dish has it all: al dente rigatoni, sautéed bell pepper, and flavorful 
            chicken sausage, all tossed in a mouthwatering, creamy pink sauce. Of course, the festivities wouldn’t be 
            complete without a generous sprinkle of Parmesan. Now, let the carb celebrations commence!
        </p>

            <li>2 Scallions</li>
            <li>12 Ounce Rigatoni Pasta</li>
            <li>3 Ounce Tomato Paste</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup Parmesan Cheese</li>
            <li>1 Tsp Olive Oil</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp Butter</li>

            <li>Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry produce. 
                Core, deseed, and dice bell pepper. 
                Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. 
                Add bell pepper and cook until lightly browned and slightly softened, 3-4 minutes. 
                Add sausage* and scallion whites; cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. 
                Season with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once water is boiling, add rigatoni to pot. 
                Cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 9-11 minutes.
                Reserve ½ cup pasta cooking water, then drain.
            </li>
            <li>
                While pasta cooks, stir Italian Seasoning, tomato paste, and 1 tsp sugar (2 tsp for 4 servings) into pan 
                with sausage mixture until coated.
                Pour in ¼ cup plain water (1⁄3 cup for 4). Bring to a simmer and cook for 1 minute, then reduce heat to low.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add cream sauce base to pan with sauce. Stir in 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings) until melted. Season with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add drained rigatoni to pan with sauce; toss to coat. 
                If needed, stir in reserved pasta cooking water a splash at a time until pasta is coated in a creamy sauce.
                Divide pasta between bowls and top with Parmesan. Garnish with scallion greens and serve.
